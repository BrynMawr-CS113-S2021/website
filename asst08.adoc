*Due Friday, April 30, before midnight*

*Goals*

* Read data from a file
* Use lists and classes to store data
* Use search and sort to work with a real-life data set

NOTE: You are given basecode and data for this assignment. Check your dropbox to get started!

= Restaurant dataset

For this assignment, we will be working with data from a real life
link:https://www.yelp.com/dataset[dataset] maintained by 
link:https://www.yelp.com[Yelp]. Yelp provides information and reviews for a
wide range of businesses. We will look at a subset containing only
restaurants, bars, and cafes.

The dataset is available as a CSV file (CSV stands for "comma separated values"). 
Each line of the file contains information for a single restaurant. 
The restaurants are listed in the file in *alphabetical order by name*.

How have two datasets to work with in this assignment. They can be found in your dropbox.

* restaurants.csv
* restaurants-small.csv

Below is an example line. 

[source]
----
1 Pot,Calgary,AB,31,3.500000,Buffets; Chinese; Hot Pot; Restaurants; Dim Sum; Asian Fusion; Fondue
----

Each line contains the following information.

* Restaurant name ("1 Pot")
* City where restaurant is located (Calgary) 
* State/Provence where restaurant is located (AB) 
* Number of reviews (31)
* Average review (3.5)
* Categories for the restaurant (Buffets; Chinese; Hot Pot; Restaurants; Dim Sum; Asian Fusion; Fondue
) Categories are separated with a `;`  

:sectnums:

= Restaurant class 

Implement a class, `Restaurant`, in the file `Restaurant.java`. This class should hold the data 
we read in from our CSV files. This class should also have accessors for each instance variable. 
Test your class in a `main` function defined in `Restaurant.java`.

*Data*

* Restaurant Name (String)
* City (String)
* State (String)
* Average stars (double)
* Number of reviews (int)
* categories (array of String)

*Methods*

* Constructor. This function should initialize the data inside `Restaurant`
* Accessors for the restaurant name, city, state, review count, average review, and categories
** `public String getName()`
** `public String getCity()`
** `public String getState()`
** `public int getReviewCount()`
** `public double getStars()`
** `public String[] getCategories()`

Below is example output for a `main` which tests Restaurant.

----
$ *java Restaurant*
           Name: Test
           City: Philadelphia,PA
        Reviews: 10
          Stars: 3.5
     Categories: [BBQ, Cafe]
----

= Restaurant utilities

Implement a class, `RestaurantUtil`, that implements two static functions for working 
with Restaurants.

== Load

In the file, `RestaurantUtil.java`, write a function, `Load`, that reads a file containing restaurant information into an array.

This function should adhere to the following specification.

[source]
----
// Function: Load
// Read the restaurant information in filename and return an array of restaurants
// Input: filename (String), the file to read. Should be a CSV of restaurants
// Returns Restaurant[] (array of Restaurant)
public static void Restaurant[] Load(String filename)
----

Hints and recommendations:

* Use the class `In`, defined in java-introcs, to load the file, e.g. `In file = new In(filename)`
* Read in all the lines of the file at once using the function `String[] lines = file.readAllLines()`
* Use the function, `split`, to split a string based on a character. For example `String[] items = current.split(",")` would split a line into an array of `String` based on commas.
* Initialize an array of restaurants based on the number of lines
* For each line, create a Restaurant object and save it in the array

== Print

In the file, `RestaurantUtil.java`, write a function, `Print`, that prints the restaurants in an array.
You may format the display how you wish, but the output should be clean and easy to read.

This function should adhere to the following specification.

[source]
----
// Function: Print
// Print the first `maxToShow` restaurants in the array restaurants
// Input: restaurants (Restaurant[]), an array containing restaurants
// Input: maxToShow (int), the number of items to show
// Returns none
public static void Print(Restaurant[] restaurants, int maxToShow) 
----

== Test

In the file `RestaurantUtil.java`, test `Load` and `Print` in main. 

* Load the file `restaurants-small.csv`
* Call Print with maxToShow = 3
* Call Print with maxToShow = 100

Below is sample output

= Restaurant App

In the file, `RestaurantApp.java`, implement an application that lets users search 
for restaurant information from our dataset. Your application should have three 
features:

* Searching for a restaurant by name
* Summarizing the restaurants in a given city
* Searching for restaurants that fit a given category

Below is sample output:

* link:logs/yelp-name-search.txt[Searching by restaurant name.]
* link:logs/yelp-city-search.txt[Summarizing city restaurants.]
* link:logs/yelp-keyword-category-search.txt[Searching by category.]

General hint and requirements:

* Your program should not crash on bad input
* Your program should have an option to Quit 
* We recommend you implement each feature in its own function. 
* We recommend you load the data set and implement your main application loop in `main`. 

Below is a possible algorithm for your application's `main`

[source]
----
dataset = Load("restaurant.csv")
while !timeToQuit
    show the options to the user
    ask the user for their choice
    if choice == 1
       doRestaurantNameLookup(dataset)
    else if choice == 2
       doCityStats(dataset)
    else if choice == 3
       doSearchByCategory(dataset)
----

== Search names

Implement a feature which allows the user to search by name. 

link:logs/yelp-name-search.txt[Click here to see examples of running this feature.]

Features:

* Ask the user for the name to search for
* The search should be case *insensitive*. Hint: Use `toLowerCase()` when comparing strings.
* Because the names are alphabetized, use binary search to find a name
* If a restaurant is found, display all its information in a table. 
Your output does not need to be identical, but it should be clean and easy to read. 
* You are not allowed to use any of Pythonâ€™s built-in search functions.

== City summary

Implement a feature which summarizes the restaurants for a given city. 

link:logs/yelp-city-search.txt[Click here to see an example of running this feature.]

Features:

* Ask the user for a city and state to search
* Prints the number of restaurants in that city
* Prints the average number of reviews for a restaurant
* Prints the max number of reviews for a restaurant
* Prints the min number of reviews for a restaurant
* Prints the average number of Stars 
* Outputs the results in a table with aligned columns
* You may not use built-in min, max, or sum functions!

NOTE: This dataset includes restaurants for Las Vegas, Phoenix, Mississauga,
Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Cleveland, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Scottsdale.

== Search categories

Implement a feature that allows the user to search restaurant categories for a 
keyword.

link:logs/yelp-keyword-category-search.txt[Click here for examples of searching categories.]

Features/Hints:

* You are given a function `filterByKeyword` that returns an array of restaurants which match the keyword. Study this function to see examples of
** Doing case-insenstive string comparisons (Hint: use `toLowerCase()`)
** The keyword can appear anywhere in the list of categories (Hint: use `contains`)
* Sort the filtered restaurants by number of reviews
* The program should show the name, location, review count, and stars for each restaurant 
* You may not use Java's built-in sorting algorithms!
* ...but you can implement any sorting algorithm you like best!

To implement this feature, you should first get a list of all restaurants that match the keyword.
Then you should sort this list based on the number of reviews. Then, you should show the top 25 
results to the user. Below is psuedocode for this feature

[source]
----
ask user for the keyword
Restaurant[] filtered = searchCategoryByKeyword(keyword, dataset)
if filtered has more than 0 items in it
   sort filtered by number of reviews (from most reviews to least)
   Print the top 25 items in filterByKeyword
else
   tell user that keyword is not found
