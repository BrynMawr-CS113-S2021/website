= Menu generator

You are in charge of writing a script for the daily specials at a new restaurant
in Swarthmore: Corner Cafe. In `Menu.java`, write a program that will ask the
restaurant for three pieces of information: the _soup_ of the day, the _special_
of the day, and the _dessert_ of the day. Your program should then use this
information to generate a short description of the daily specials (i.e. a
restaurant [*madlib*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)).

Here are two examples (user input in **bold**):

[source,java]
----
$ java Menu.java
Soup: wild rice
Special: salmon
Dessert: peach cobbler

Welcome to Corner Cafe!
Our soup of the day is wild rice.
The special tonight is salmon,
and for dessert, try our world-famous peach cobbler.

$ python3 menu.py
Soup: cup noodles
Special: pizza
Dessert: M&Ms

Welcome to Corner Cafe!
Our soup of the day is cup noodles.

and for dessert, try our world-famous M&Ms.

= Cakes for sale 

Write a program called `Cakes.java` that computes the price of a cake for the 
famous bakery `Artisinal Squares`. This bakery makes exclusive square cakes, with 
prices proportional to the area.  

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ java Cakes.java
What is the cake width? 3
What is the cake height? 4.5
What is the cost per square inch? 3
The cake cost is $40.5
----

= Calculator

Write a program, `Calculator.java` that asks the user for two numbers and returns the sum, difference, product, and division of them.  

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ java Calculator.java
Enter the first number: 3.5
Enter the second number: 9.1

3.5 * 9.1 = 31.849999999999998
3.5 / 9.1 = 0.38461538461538464
3.5 + 9.1 = 12.6
3.5 - 9.1 = -5.6
