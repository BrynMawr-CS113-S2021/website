= Tic-tac-toe

_credit: Sara Mathieson_

Write a program, `Tictactoe.java`, that implements the game of 
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe[tic-tac-toe]. 
In this game, players alternate between placing their symbol (either an "X" or an "O")
inside a 3x3 grid of squares. The first player to get "3 in a row" (either on a
row, a column, or diagonally) wins.

In our version, the user will play against the computer (the Artificial Intelligence, or "AI").
The AI will always play first and use the symbol "O", and the user will play second with a
symbol "X". The game can end with the user winning, the AI winning, or a draw.

Here are examples of these three situations:

* link:logs/a5-userwin.html[User wins]
* link:logs/a5-aiwins.html[AI wins]
* link:logs/a5-tie.html[Tie]

== 3x3 Board

In order to implement tic-tac-toe we will be using a **list of characters** to represent
the board. The board will begin as a list of 9 empty spaces:

[source]
----
char[] board = {' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' '};
----

The board will be modified over the course of the game. 
For debugging, use the Java function `Array.toString(board)`. 
For example, suppose the AI chooses 3, we can print the board with:

[source]
----
board[3] = 'O';
System.out.println(Array.toString(board));
----

The above code will print the following to the console:

[source]
----
[' ',' ',' ','O',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ']
----

And then if the user plays 7 and we print, the board will look like:

[source]
----
[' ',' ',' ','O',' ',' ',' ','X',' ']
----


== Main Function

Your `main()` function should use the functions below to do the bulk of the work.  
  The general outline of the program is as follows:

. Print out a welcome message. You can do this in main, or define a function for it.
. Set up initial variables before entering the game loop. You will need at least the board and a way to keep track of whether someone has won yet.
. Set up your game loop. Each time through the loop, either the user will play, or the AI will play. The board will be *modified* during each turn. If one of the players has won, the loop should exit. 
. Print the output of the game, such as "AI won!", "You won!", "A tie!" 

== AI turn


Implement a function, `aiTurn`. This function should place an `O` at a random
open spot on the board. `aiTurn` should be called from `main` during the game
loop. 

You implementation should have this specification:

[source]
----
// Function: aiTurn
// Implements one turn of the AI player. 
//   Default behavior: chooses a random open spot
// Input board (char[]): the 3x3 tic-tac-toe board 
// Returns (int): the index of the board that is modified
public static int aiTurn(char[] board)
----

This function takes in a **list of characters** and **modifies the board** to
reflect the AI's chosen cell (no return value). The cells are numbered 0-8,
inclusive. The choice cannot be a cell that is already taken by a symbol. 

You are welcome to make an "intelligent" AI, but the recommended approach is
to make the computer choose a cell randomly. A simple approach is to continually 
choose random cells until it finds a free one.

You can choose whether to have the function modify the board (the change will persist 
after the function returns because arrays are *mutable*) or to modify the 
board after the function returns to `main`, using the returned integer. 

After the AI's turn, `main` should print the AI's choice

```
AI chooses: 7
```

== Player turn

Implement a function, `userTurn`, that implements the player's turn. This function should 
check that the user enters a valid integer. 

. The integer is between 0 and 8, inclusive.
. The cell is not already taken by a symbol.

Keep asking the user to choose an integer until they choose a valid cell. For example,
if there were already a symbol in the 5 cell, the player turn might look like this:

[source,subs=quotes]
----
Enter 0-8 for your choice: **5**
Invalid input: 5
Enter 0-8 for your choice: **10**
Invalid input: 10
Enter 0-8 for your choice: **-3**
Invalid input: -3
Enter 0-8 for your choice: **0**
----

`playerTurn` should implement the following specification

[source]
----
// Function: playerTurn
// Asks the user which cell they want to place their `X`. 
//    Ensures the player chooses a valid index.
// Input board (char[]): the 3x3 tic-tac-toe board
// Returns (int): the index chosen by the player 
public static int playerTurn(char[] board)
----

You can choose whether to have the function modify the board (the change will persist 
after the function returns because arrays are *mutable*) or to modify the 
board after the function returns in `main`, using the returned integer. 

== Display the board

Implement a function, `displayBoard`, that prints the current board to the screen.
Below is the specification

[source]
----
// Function: displayBoard
// Displays the tic-tac-toe board as a 3x3 grid 
// Input board (char[]): the tic-tac-toe board
// Returns: none
public static void displayBoard(char[] board)
----

Board is an array with 9 characters. You need to print it as a 3x3 square grid.
One approach is the use a for loop that progresses in threes, for example, see 
what happens when you try this code

[source]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 9; i += 3) {
  System.out.printf("%d|%d|%d\n", i, i+1, i+2);
}
----

== Check for wins

Implement a function, `isWinner` which tests whether either the AI or player wins.
Below is the specification

[source]
----
Function: isWinner
Returns true if the given symbol controls a complete row, col, or diagonal; False otherwise
Input board (char[]): the 3x3 tic-tac-toe board
Input sym (char): the character, either 'O' or 'X'
Return (boolean): true if the sym has won the board; false otherwise
----

Note that we can detect that a tie has ocurred if no turns are left and no one won the 
game.

For example, calling isWinner with the following board and `'X'` returns false but with `'O'`
returns true

[source]
----
-------
|O|X|X|
|O|O|O|
|X|X|O|
-------
----

= Extra challenge

Implement your own unique tic-tac-toe game in `MyTicTacToe.java`. Be sure to point out to us 
your work in your readme. Below are ideas

* Implement more sophisticated decision making for the AI turn
* Use StdDraw to display the board with graphics
* Support bigger boards!

= What to hand-in

. The program, `Tictactoe.java`, and if applicable, `MyTictactoe.java`
. Make sure your program has a header containing your name, date, and purpose of the program
. A brief write-up containing your name, assignment number, and a few sentences about how long you 
spent on the assignment and any interesting bugs you solved. Be sure to highlight any 
customizations you made for your game!!

== How to hand-in

. Copy your files to your dropbox, into the folder called `A05`.
