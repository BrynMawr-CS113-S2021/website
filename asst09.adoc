*Due Friday, May 7, before midnight*

*Goals*

* Practice writing recursive functions

= Recursive functions

In the file, `Recursion.java`, write each of the following functions
*recursively*. You are given link:Recursion.java[basecode] containing
functions stubs along with a `main` for testing. You can download the 
link:Recursion.java[basecode] here or use the file in Dropbox.

* link:#q1[even numbers]
* link:#q3[reverse a string]
* link:#q4[blastoff]
* link:#q5[get integer divisible by 3 ]
* link:#q6[xerox]
* link:#q7[raise to power]
* link:#q8[is palindrome?]
* link:#q12[count in string]
//* link:#q1[sum a list]
//* link:#q2[max of a list]
//* link:#q9[is sorted?]
//* link:#q10[in list? ]
//* link:#q11[coin flips ]

NOTE: You must not modify the function parameters and return types for the given functions!

. even numbers anchor:q1[]
+
Function `reven(int n)` should recursively sum the even numbers starting at 2 and ending at n. 
For example, `reven(10)` should return 2+4+6+8+10 = 30. 
+
//1) sum a list anchor:q1[]
//Function should recursively sum all items in a given list and return the sum.
//For example: the list `{1,2,3,4,5}` should return 15, and an empty list should
//return 0. 
+
//2) max of a list anchor:q2[]
//Function should recursively find the largest item in the list and return
//it. For example: the list `{5,20,-4,18}` has max of 20.
+
. reverse a string anchor:q3[]
+
Function `rrevStr(String word)` should return the reverse of a given string.
For example: the reverse of `"hello"` is `"olleh"`.
+
. blastoff anchor:q4[]
+
Function `rblastoff(int n)`should count down (print one number per line) from the given
start number to 1, then print "blastoff!".
For example, `rblastoff(10)` should count down from 10 to 1, then print
"blastoff!".
+
. get integer divisible by 3 anchor:q5[]
+
Function (`rgetMod()`) asks the user to enter an integer that is divisible
by 3. Assume the user will enter an integer. If the given integer is not divisible 
by 3 (Hint: use `%` to check), the function should recursively ask the user for 
another integer. This function should return the valid integer. 
Below is console output from running `rgetMod`.
+
[source,subs=quotes]
----
Enter a number: *4*
Not divisible by 3!
Enter a number: *6*
----
+
NOTE: `rgetMod` should return the user's number! 
+
. xerox anchor:q6[]
+
Function (`rxerox(String phrase,int n)`) should generate and
return a String containing `n` copies of the item.
For example, `rxerox("paper", 4)` should return `"paperpaperpaperpaper"`,
and `rxerox("2", 10)` should return `"2222222222"`.
+
. raise to power anchor:q7[]
+
Function `rraise(int n, int m)` returns `n` raised to the mth power.
For example, calling `rraise(6,2)` returns 36.
+
. is palindrome? anchor:q8[]
+
Function `risPalindrome(String text)` returns `true` if given text is a palindrome
(same forwards and backwards) and `false` otherwise. For example, `risPalindrome("HANNAH")`
should return `true`.
+
//9) is sorted?           anchor:q9[]
//Function `risSorted(L)` returns `true` if the given list is in-order and `false` otherwise.
//For example, the list `{1,2,3,4,5}` should return `true`.
+
//10) in list? anchor:q10[]
//Function `rinList(x,L)` returns `true` if `x` is in the list `L`.
//For example, `rinList` should return `true` if x is 3 and the list is 
//`{-1,2,4,3,6}`. 
+
//11) coin flips anchor:q11[]
//Function `rcoinFlip(n)` flips a coin `n` times, and returns the total
//number of Heads. For example, `rcoinFlip(100)` might return 50 (or 49, or
//51, etc). (Hint: to toss a coin, compute a random int which is either 0 or 1).
+
. count in String  anchor:q12[]
+
Function `rcount(char x,String S)` returns how many times `x` is in the String `S`.
For example, `rcount("a", "aardvark")` should return 3.

= Testing your functions

You are given test code in `main`. Functions that return a value are tested using the 
`test` function. This function throws an exception if the function returns an incorrect value. 
For example, suppose there is a bug in our function `rrevStr`, running gives this error

[source]
----
java.lang.Exception: Test Failed: yolleh != olleh
        at Recursion.test(Recursion.java:118)
        at Recursion.main(Recursion.java:133)
----

The above error shows us that our function returned "yolleh" but should have 
returned the value "olleh". We can also see that the function we need to fix 
is called on line 133. 

We encourage you to add your own tests! 

= What to hand-in

. The program, `Recursion.java`
. Make sure your programs have a header containing your name, date, and description.
. No writeup is necessary for this assignment

== How to hand-in

. Copy your files to your dropbox, into the folder called `A09`.
