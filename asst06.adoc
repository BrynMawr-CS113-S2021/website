**Due Friday, April 16, before midnight**

The goals of this assignment are:

* Work with classes, and objects
* Work with loops, conditionals, and variables
* Work with arrays, Strings, and files

In this assignment, you will implement a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundboard_(computer_program)[sound
board], a program for playing short sound clips. 

We will use classes to organize our program. The `Sound` class will represent 
individual clips, stored in a WAV file. The `SoundLibrary` class will manage 
a list of `Sound` objects. The full program, `SoundBoard`, will 
present the user with a list of sounds and allow them to play them.

:stem: latexmath

= Sound

Write a program, `Sound.java`, which implements and tests a class names `Sound`. Your sound class 
represents a sound clip stored in a WAV. It should contain the name, duration, and WAV file of 
the sound. 

*Requirements*

* `Sound` contains the following data (all data should be private): 
** mName of the sound (String)
** mDuration of the sound in seconds (double)
** mFilename of the WAV file (String)

* `Sound` contains the following methods:
** Constructor `Sound(String name, double duration, String fileName)`, which initializes the object with the given information.
** `void play()`, which plays the sound stored in this class by calling `StdAudio.play`   
** `String getName()`, accessor for the sound's name
** `double getDuration()`, accessor for the sound's duration

In `main`, test all the functions in your class. For example, the following code should produce 
the following output (and play the cricket sound). 

[source]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Sound sound = new Sound("cricket", 0.5, "wav/337435__ev-dawg__cricket.wav");
    System.out.printf("Sound: %s (%.2fs)\n", sound.getName(), sound.getDuration());
    sound.play();
}

$ *javac-introcs Song.java*
$ *java-introcs* Song
Sound: cricket (0.50s)
----

= SoundLibrary

Write a program, `SoundLibrary.java`, which stores a list of songs

*Features*

* `SoundLibrary` contains the following data (all data should be private): 
** array of Sounds (Sound[])

* SoundLibrary contains the following methods:
** Constructor `SoundLibrary(String filename)`, initializes the object using a list of songs stored in a file
** `void list()`, lists all the sounds available in the library
** `int getNumSounds()`, returns the number of sounds in the library
** `void play(int songNumber)`, plays the sound corresponding to the given soundNumber. The first sound in the library has soundNumber 0. The second sound has soundNumber 1, etc. 

In `main`, test all the functions in your class. For example, the following code should produce 
the following output (and play the sound entitled "magic"). 

[source]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SoundLibrary library = new SoundLibrary("sounds.txt");
    library.list();
    library.play(1);
}

0) meow - 1.00s
1) magic - 6.00s
2) gong - 12.00s
3) applause - 6.00s
4) crickets - 0.50s
5) yeah - 2.00s
6) beat-n-bass - 3.00s
7) whistle - 8.00s
8) trombone - 3.00s
----

To initialize the sound library, you will need to read in and parse the file `sounds.txt`. 

* The first line in `sounds.txt` contains the number of sounds in the file
* Each subsequent line corresponds to a single sound. The information for each sound is separated by spaces 
** sound name
** sound duration
** sound filename (relative path)

= SoundBoard

Write a program, `SoundBoard.java`, that uses `SoundLibrary` to list and play sounds. 
This program shows the user a menu of sounds and lets them choose different sounds to play. 

Your program should support the following commands: 

* *quit*: Quit the program
* *<id>*: Play the song with the given id. Prints an error if the id is invalid. 

If the user enters an invalid command, your program should print an error.
