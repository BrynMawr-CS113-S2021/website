**Due Friday, march 5, before midnight**

The goals of this assignment are:

* Work with conditional statements
* Work with boolean types
* Work with both command line arguments and interactive input

= What are the hours?

Implement a program `Hours.java` which inputs the number of minutes and outputs the number of hourse in 
with human friendly text.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **java Hours 67**
1 hours and 7 minutes

$ **java Hours 453**
7 hours and 33 minutes

$ **java Hours 360**
6 hours and 0 minutes
----

You may assume that the input to the program is a positive integer, i.e. a
whole number greater than 0. 


# Pythagorean Triples

A [Pythagorean triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple) is a
set of three positive integers *a*, *b*, and *c* such that the sum of the
squares of two of the numbers equals the square of the third. i.e.

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

In this example, *a* and *b* represent the shorter sides of a right triangle and
*c* represents the hypotenuse.

Write a program in `Pythagoras.java` that determines whether or not three numbers
entered by the user form a valid Pythagorean triple. The numbers can be in any
order. If the numbers do form a Pythagorean triple, print out a message that
includes the hypotenuse (longest side). If not, print out a helpful message.
Here are a few examples of how your program should work:

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **java Pythagoras**
Enter side 1: **4**
Enter side 2: **5**
Enter side 3: **3**
Pythagorean triple with hypotenuse 5

$ **java Pythagoras**
Enter side 1: **13**
Enter side 2: **5**
Enter side 3: **12**
Pythagorean triple with hypotenuse 13

$ **java Pythagoras**
Enter side 1: **8**
Enter side 2: **4**
Enter side 3: **9**
Not a Pythagorean triple!

= Speeding fines!

Write a program called `Speeding.java` that calculates speeding fines based on the traffic laws of the state of Pennsylvania.  Here is a short description of the fine structure:

_For most speeding violations, the fine is $35 plus $2 for every
mile **in excess of 5 mph** over the limit. However, if the maximum limit is 65 mph or higher, the fine is $42.50 plus $2 for every mile **in excess of 5 mph** over the limit._

The goal of this law is to discourage motorists from driving
significantly over the posted limits.  If the motorist is traveling
just slightly over the limit (within 5 mph), then only a base fine is
applied.  However, if the motorist's speed exceeds the limit by more
than 5 mph, then an extra fine is applied.

See the table below for some example scenarios.

.Example Fines
|===
| Speed | Limit | Over | Excess > 5 |  Base fine | Extra fine | Total fine
| 45 | 50 |  0 |  0 |  0.00 |  0.00 |  0.00
| 52 | 50 |  2 |  0 | 35.00 |  0.00 | 35.00
| 65 | 50 | 15 | 10 | 35.00 | 20.00 | 55.00
| 69 | 65 |  4 |  0 | 42.50 |  0.00 | 42.50
| 75 | 65 | 10 |  5 | 42.50 | 10.00 | 52.50
|===

Below are some examples of the running program. User input is shown in
**bold**.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **java Speeding**

Enter speed limit: **55**
Enter clocked speed: **45**

Motorist is within the limit

$ **java Speeding**

Enter speed limit: **55**
Enter clocked speed: **58**

Motorist is over the limit by 3 mph

Total fine is: $35.00

$ **java Speeding**

Enter speed limit: **55**
Enter clocked speed: **63**

Motorist is over the limit by 8 mph

Base fine is: $35.00
Additional $2 per 3 miles in excess of 5 mph over limit
Total fine is: $41.00

$ **java Speeding**

Enter speed limit: **65**
Enter clocked speed: **69**

Motorist is over the limit by 4 mph

Total fine is: $42.50

= What to hand-in

. The programs, `Pythagoras.java`, `Hours.java`, and `Speeding.java`.
. Make sure each program has a header containing your name, date, and purpose of the program
. A brief write-up containing your name, assignment number, and a few sentences about how long you 
spent on the assignment and any interesting bugs you solved.  

== How to hand-in

. Copy your programs to your dropbox, into the folder called `A2`.
